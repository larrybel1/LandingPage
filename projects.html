								<p>Infant Mortality rates have on average been going down thoughtout the years, especially with women being constantly 
									monitered and cared for while they are pregnant. As with any mortality rate, with newer medicine and better understanding
									of the casues, causes them to go down. With this his project, I wanted to tackle whether or not the average Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
									per capita of a country impacted that countries infant mortality rates (IMR) per capita. By downloading an excel sheet with the necessary information of 
									every country on earth, and uploading it into MATLAB. I used techniques to build graphs that showed the corrilation between GDP and IMR. With
									the scripts, the one can take a closer look at individual countries, or produce a GIF of the changed happening to every country over the years.
									With these graphs, we can make the conclution that although for some countries, the increase in GDP does decrease the IMR, it isn't the truth for 
									every country and something else could be the cause of it decreasing.

								<h2>No Child Left Behind & Human Right to Education</h2>
								<blockquote>Education is a right often included as it is part of the Social, Economic, and Cultural Rights. It is written in a plethora of treaties and acts, starting with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. 
									With all these treaties clearly labeling having the right to education, it is logical to think that the right to education is also included somewhere in U.S. law. This is, however, not the case. 
									Education isn't mentioned anywhere in the Constitution nor in any of the amendments to it. This doesn't mean that it isn't a right that can earn protection. 
									As seen with the Brown v. Board of Education, education and the discrimination to it can be acknowledge and address with the laws in place in the U.S. 
									Along with the ideas of progressive realization, education being part of the Social, Economic, and Cultural Rights makes it so that as the U.S. grows economically, those rights have to slowly be realized, acknowledged and protected.

								<p>This projects started out of a passion and need to find graphs. During my last two years in college as I stated to write essays with somewhat obscure topics
									it became harder to find the necessary data to back up claims that I read in artile. The graphs that these authors aluded weren't the easiest to find. Thus,
									the idea for this project came to be. Taking insperation from the the Infant Mortality & GDP project, I used the World Bank API in a python script that takes 
									the user though prompts asking it which indicator and country they would like to look at. Instead of looking though the internet for a graph talked
									about in an article or book, one can use this to create one that could suport a point that they are trying to get across. 
								</p>
								<p>Here is the link to my <a href="https://github.com/larrybel1/World_Bank.git" class="pop-link">github repository</a> with the code used to create the graphs above and below. There you'll also see how the information is obtained
									from the API.
