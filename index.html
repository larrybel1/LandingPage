											<h2>Introduction</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Hey! My name is Larry Bello-Castillo a recent graduate from Trinity College who studied Human Rights and Mathematics. I want
											to be able to use data to answer questions that otherwise might not have a cut and dry answer. Having studied both Human Rights 
											Mathematics at the undergrad level, I have found that I want to be able to use numbers to help guide and shape the way policy is
											structure to better serve the people it's supposed to help.

								<p class="content">No Child Left Behind (NCLB) was one of the most impactful educational polices ever passed. It had the 
									posibility of being THE policy that determining what the legacy of the the Bush administration was going to be. I myself 
									am a product of 
									the NCLB policy and wanted to explore why it didn't achieve what it was made for. Why the strategies that it used didn't tacked
									 and fix the issues that we still see in out public education system. 
									 And when taking a look at those reasons and strategies how it took affected, and in some cases took away,
									childs Human Right to Education.</p>

									<h2>Milestones/Goals</h2>
									<p>There have been some very notable milestones that I have acheived. One of these being the first person 
										in my family to go and graduate from college. Since graduation day there have been a lot of small adult
										milestones that I have acheived such as moving into an apartment with my girlfriend and getting my frist job outside
										of college. However with these milestones being comleted, goals and dreams have sprung up that I wish to also acomplish.
										One of these dreams is going into a PHD program as well as the next adulting goals of buying a house. I want to be someone
										that other can look up to but also someone my youngerself can be proud of.
